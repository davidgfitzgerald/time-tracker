# time-tracker
App to track time spent on tasks

## Requirements

- `Node` (version TBD)
- `Docker` (version TBD)

## Quick Start

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This requires port `5432` to be available to start a postgres DB docker container.
